            <h3>A brief timeline of Cmdr. Shepard's life and exploits:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>2154</b> - On April 11, Shepard is born in space. Both of Shepard's parents were lifelong officers in the human Systems Alliance military. They served primarily aboard starships, never staying in one location for more than a few years.</li>
                <li><b>2157</b> - Humanity makes first contacts with an alien species, the turians. This results in a heated, but short conflict between the two species. The Citadel Council steps in to maintain the peace, and humanity is introduced to the
                    galatic community.
                </li>
                <li><b>2168</b> - At the age of 14, Shepard receives secondary exposure to element zero, and his biotic abilities begin to manifest.</li>
                <li><b>2171</b> - Shepard is officially declared biotic by the Systems Alliance and is given L3 biotic implants.</li>
                <li><b>2172</b> - Following in his parents' footsteps, Shepard enlists in the Alliance military at the age of 18.</li>
                <li><b>Roughly 2177</b> - Early in his military career, Shepard faced an overwhelming enemy force. Risking his own life, he saved his fellow soliders and defeated the enemy in the face of impossible odds. His bravery was rewarded with medals
                    and recogition from Alliance admirals, and Shepard is almost universally recognized as a war hero. </li>
                <li><b>2178</b> - Shepard is invited to join the Interplanetary Combatives Academy, undergoes elite training and is awarded the highly coveted N7 designation. Around this time, he is promoted to the rank of Commander.</li>
                <li><b>Early 2183</b> - Shepard is posted to the SSV Normandy as Executive Officer under Captain David Anderson. The Normandy was (at the time) the most advanced ship in Citadel space. </li>
                <li><b>2183</b> - The human colony of Eden Prime is attacked by the geth. After exposing the involvement of rogue Spectre Saren Arterius in the attack, Shepard is given command of the Normandy and becomes the first human Spectre, one of several
                    elite agents for the Citadel Council. With the Council's blessing, Shepard and the crew of the Normandy pursue Saren in his search for the Conduit, who is later revealed as being manipulated and part of a larger plan crafted by Sovereign,
                    a Reaper, to return its kind to the galaxy. Shepard defeats Saren and the Alliance Navy destroys Sovereign, preventing the return of the Reapers.</li>
                <li><b>2183 (one month later)</b> - The Normandy is attacked and destroyed by an unidentified assailant, resulting in the death of Commander Shepard. Later, the Systems Alliance officially declares Shepard "killed in action".</li>
                <li><b>2185</b> - Commander Shepard is revived by pro-human organization Cerberus and is charged with investigating the mysterious disappearances of entire human colonies. Investigation of the attacked colony of Freedom's Progress reveals
                    the Collectors to be responsible for the disappearances (and Shepard's near-death). After assembling a capable team, Commander Shepard uses a captured Reaper IFF to safely infiltrate the Collectors' headquarters, where they were manufacturing
                    a human-based Reaper. Shepard succeeds in eliminating the Collector threat, saving humanity throughout the galaxy from certain destruction.</li>
                <li><b>2186</b> - The Reapers invade the Milky Way galaxy. Commander Shepard and allies embark on a journey to unite the all species in the midst of a galaxy-wide war. During the final confrontation with the Reapers over Earth, Shepard makes
                    a decision that changes the galaxy forever.</li>
            </ul>
