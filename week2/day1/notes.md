*First LECTURE*

there are tons of html elements out there - you can build a pretty decent page with some of these and virtually no CSS.

a:link will be the color of links on your page using the "a" tag.
a:visited will be the color of *visited* links on your page that use the "a" tag.

X + Y
if the two elments are right next to each other, this will allow you to give a specfic styling to the space between (ie, maybe you want to drop a border in)

X > Y
Any Y item nested inside X item will be given this styles

Flex is a super powerful tool for spacing items within a container - FREAKING USE IT NEXT TIME THEY HAVE ONE OF THESE RIDICULOUS ASSIGNMENTS.

Some good examples are in the 'wideOpen' doc that I just worked with, also JS Bin 5

*Second LECTURE*

He would recommend redoing some old projects so that you learn different techniques for doing the same thing.

HTML elements: the different tags used in the files.
Semantic HTML: He can structure HTML with just divs because that's what people know and it's easy. Semantic HTML is something that tries to use the different tags to describe your intent (and you can obviously style those however you want)

Box model:
Margin, padding, border. He looks it up every time on CSS Tricks.

See all of the JS Bins.

The chrome dev tools allow you to essentially code the page on the fly and see it in real time. Once you're a fan of what's on the page, you can copy paste the new code into your editor.
