*First LECTURE*

there are tons of html elements out there - you can build a pretty decent page with some of these and virtually no CSS.

a:link will be the color of links on your page using the "a" tag.
a:visited will be the color of *visited* links on your page that use the "a" tag.

X + Y
if the two elments are right next to each other, this will allow you to give a specfic styling to the space between (ie, maybe you want to drop a border in)

X > Y
Any Y item nested inside X item will be given this stylessddddddddd

Flex is a super powerful tool for spacing items within a container - FREAKING USE IT NEXT TIME THEY HAVE ONE OF THESE RIDICULOUS ASSIGNMENTS.

Some good examples are in the 'wideOpen' doc that I just worked with
